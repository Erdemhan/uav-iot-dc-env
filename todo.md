# To-Do List

This file tracks planned improvements and current tasks for the project.

## Priority Improvements
- [ ] **RL Agent Integration:** Attacker determines power using a smart strategy (DQN/PPO) instead of random power.
- [ ] **UAV Evasion Maneuver:** UAV changes altitude or deviates from route when jamming is detected.
- [ ] **Dynamic Node Positioning:** Scenario where IoT nodes are mobile.
- [ ] **Power Consumption Analysis:** Detailed graphing of the energy impact of different flight modes (Hover vs Cruise).

## Refactoring / Maintenance
- [ ] **Config Separation:** Reading parameters dynamically from a JSON/YAML file.
- [ ] **Log Visualization:** Real-time display of metric graphs (Matplotlib) in a separate window during monitoring.
